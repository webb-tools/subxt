## [0.24.0] - 2022-09-22

This release has a bunch of smaller changes and fixes. The breaking changes are fairly minor and should be easy to address if encountered. Notable additions are:
- Allowing the underlying RPC implementation to be swapped out ([#634](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/634)). This makes `jsonrpsee` an optional dependency, and opens the door for Subxt to be integrated into things like light clients, since we can decide how to handle RPC calls.
- A low level "runtime upgrade" API is exposed, giving more visibility into when node updates happen in case your application needs to handle them.
- `scale-value` and `scale-decode` dependencies are bumped. The main effect of this is that `bitvec` is no longer used under the hood in the core of Subxt, which helps to remove one hurdle on the way to being able to compile it to WASM.

## [0.23.0] - 2022-08-11

This is one of the most significant releases to date in Subxt, and carries with it a number of significant breaking changes, but in exchange, a number of significant improvements. The most significant PR is [#593](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/593); the fundamental change that this makes is to separate creating a query/transaction/address from submitting it. This gives us flexibility when creating queries; they can be either dynamically or statically generated, but also flexibility in our client, enabling methods to be exposed for online or offline use.

The best place to look to get a feel for what's changed, aside from the documentation itself, is the `examples` folder. What follows are some examples of the changes you'll need to make, which all follow a similar pattern:

### Submitting a transaction

Previously, we'd build a client which is tied to the static codegen, and then use the client to build and submit a transaction like so:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<_>>>();

let balance_transfer = api
    .tx()
    .balances()
    .transfer(dest, 10_000)?
    .sign_and_submit_then_watch_default(&signer)
    .await?
    .wait_for_finalized_success()
    .await?;
```

Now, we build a transaction separately (in this case, using static codegen to guide us as before) and then submit it to a client like so:

``` rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let balance_transfer_tx = polkadot::tx().balances().transfer(dest, 10_000);

let balance_transfer = api
    .tx()
    .sign_and_submit_then_watch_default(&balance_transfer_tx, &signer)
    .await?
    .wait_for_finalized_success()
    .await?;
```

See the `examples/examples/submit_and_watch.rs` example for more.

### Fetching a storage entry

Previously, we build and submit a storage query in one step:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<DefaultConfig>>>();

let entry = api.storage().staking().bonded(&addr, None).await;
```

Now, we build the storage query separately and submit it to the client:

```rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let staking_bonded = polkadot::storage().staking().bonded(&addr);

let entry = api.storage().fetch(&staking_bonded, None).await;
```

Note that previously, the generated code would do the equivalent of `fetch_or_default` if possible, or `fetch` if no default existed. You must now decide whether to:
- fetch an entry, returning `None` if it's not found (`api.storage().fetch(..)`), or
- fetch an entry, returning the default if it's not found (`api.storage().fetch_or_default(..)`).

The static types will protect you against using `fetch_or_default` when no such default exists, and so the recommendation is to try changing all storage requests to use `fetch_or_default`, falling back to using `fetch` where doing so leads to compile errors.

See `examples/examples/concurrent_storage_requests.rs` for an example of fetching entries.

### Iterating over storage entries

Previously:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<DefaultConfig>>>();

let mut iter = api
    .storage()
    .xcm_pallet()
    .version_notifiers_iter(None)
    .await?;

while let Some((key, value)) = iter.next().await? {
    // ...
}
```

Now, as before, building the storage query to iterate over is separate from using it:

```rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let key_addr = polkadot::storage()
    .xcm_pallet()
    .version_notifiers_root();

let mut iter = api
    .storage()
    .iter(key_addr, 10, None).await?;

while let Some((key, value)) = iter.next().await? {
    // ...
}
```

Note that the `_root()` suffix on generated storage queries accesses the root entry at that address,
and is available when the address is a map that can be iterated over. By not appending `_root()`, you'll
be asked to provide the values needed to access a specific entry in the map.

See the `examples/examples/storage_iterating.rs` example for more.

### Accessing constants

Before, we'd build a client and use the client to select and query a constant:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<DefaultConfig>>>();

let existential_deposit = api
    .constants()
    .balances()
    .existential_deposit()?;
```

Now, similar to the other examples, we separately build a constant _address_ and provide that address to the client to look it up:

```rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let address = polkadot::constants()
    .balances()
    .existential_deposit();

let existential_deposit = api.constants().at(&address)?;
```

See the `examples/examples/fetch_constants.rs` example for more.

### Subscribing to events

Event subscriptions themselves are relatively unchanged (although the data you can access/get back has changed a little). Before:

```rust
let api = ClientBuilder::new()
    .build()
    .await?
    .to_runtime_api::<polkadot::RuntimeApi<DefaultConfig, PolkadotExtrinsicParams<DefaultConfig>>>();

let mut event_sub = api.events().subscribe().await?;

while let Some(events) = event_sub.next().await {
    // ...
}
```

Now, we simply swap the client out for our new one, and the rest is similar:

```rust
let api = OnlineClient::<PolkadotConfig>::new().await?;

let mut event_sub = api.events().subscribe().await?;

while let Some(events) = event_sub.next().await {
    // ...
}
```

Note that when working with a single event, the method `event.bytes()` previously returned just the bytes associated with the event fields. Now, `event.bytes()` returns _all_ of the bytes associated with the event. There is a separate method, `event.field_bytes()`, that returns the bytes for just the fields in the event. This change will **not** lead to a compile error, and so it's worth keeping an eye out for any uses of `.bytes()` to update them to `.field_bytes()`.

See the `examples/examples/subscribe_all_events.rs` example for more.


The general pattern, as seen above, is that we break apart constructing a query/address and using it. You can now construct queries dynamically instead and forego all static codegen by using the functionality exposed in the `subxt::dynamic` module instead.

Other smaller breaking changes have happened, but they should be easier to address by following compile errors.

## [0.22.0] - 2022-06-20

With this release, subxt can subscribe to the node's runtime upgrades to ensure that the metadata is updated and
extrinsics are properly constructed.

We have also made some slight API improvements to make in the area of storage keys, and thanks to an external contribution we now support dry running transactions before submitting them.

This release also improves the documentation, adds UI tests, and defaults the `subxt-cli` to return metadata
bytes instead of the JSON format.

## [0.21.0] - 2022-05-02

This release adds static metadata validation, via comparing the statically generated API with the target node's runtime
metadata. This implies a breaking change in the subxt API, as the user receives an error when interacting with an
incompatible API at the storage, call, and constant level.

The `subxt-cli` can check the compatibility of multiple runtime nodes, either full metadata compatibility or
compatibility at the pallet level.

Users can define custom derives for specific generated types of the API via adding the `derive_for_type` configuration
to the `subxt` attribute.

The metadata documentation is propagated to the statically generated API.

Previously developers wanting to build the subxt crate needed the `substrate` binary dependency in their local
environment. This restriction is removed via moving the integration tests to a dedicated crate.

The number of dependencies is reduced for individual subxt crates.

### Fixed
- test-runtime: Add exponential backoff ([#518](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/518))

### Added

- Add custom derives for specific generated types ([#520](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/520))
- Static Metadata Validation ([#478](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/478))
- Propagate documentation to runtime API ([#511](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/511))
- Add `tidext` in real world usage ([#508](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/508))
- Add system health rpc ([#510](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/510))

### Changed
- Put integration tests behind feature flag ([#515](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/515))
- Use minimum amount of dependencies for crates ([#524](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/524))
- Export `BaseExtrinsicParams` ([#516](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/516))
- bump jsonrpsee to v0.10.1 ([#504](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/504))

## [0.20.0] - 2022-04-06

The most significant change in this release is how we create and sign extrinsics, and how we manage the
"additional" and "extra" data that is attached to them. See https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/issues/477, and the
associated PR https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/490 for a more detailed look at the code changes.

If you're targeting a node with compatible additional and extra transaction data to Substrate or Polkadot, the main
change you'll have to make is to import and use `subxt::PolkadotExtrinsicParams` or `subxt::SubstrateExtrinsicParams`
instead of `subxt::DefaultExtra` (depending on what node you're compatible with), and then use `sign_and_submit_default`
instead of `sign_and_submit` when making a call. Now, `sign_and_submit` accepts a second argument which allows these
parameters (such as mortality and tip payment) to be customized. See `examples/balance_transfer_with_params.rs` for a
small usage example.

If you're targeting a node which involves custom additional and extra transaction data, you'll need to implement the
trait `subxt::extrinsic::ExtrinsicParams`, which determines the parameters that can be provided to `sign_and_submit`, as
well as how to encode these into the "additional" and "extra" data needed for a transaction. Have a look at
`subxt/src/extrinsic/params.rs` for the trait definition and Substrate/Polkadot implementations. The aim with this change
is to make it easier to customise this for your own chains, and provide a simple way to provide values at runtime.
